# Hand Retargeting

This example demonstrates how to use data exclusively from Apple Vision Pro to manipulate bimanual robot hands, omitting
the robot arm component. We capture some offline Vision Pro data and employ it to create retargeting visualizations as
shown below. 

Detailed documentation can be found in our [tutorial](https://dingry.github.io/BunnyVisionPro/example/retargeting).
